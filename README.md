PracticalMachineLearning
========================

In this project, we were tasked with building a model that would predict what form of exercise was done by a participant using only measurements taken at the time of the exercise.

Participants were asked to preform a bicep curl 5 different ways; one using the correct for and another four while making common mistakes in form. Readings were taken at the arm, forearm, belt, and dumbbell while the exercises were being preformed.
